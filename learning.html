After reading "Annabel Lee" repeatedly, our idea for the film grew from a powerful image: a well-dressed man, distraught with grief, walks into the ocean and drowns himself.</br>
</br>
We shot the scene with Erick's eleven-year-old daughter as our apprentice camera operator, then Noah shared the footage with his 10th grade students, who decided to compose an original soundtrack.</br>
</br>
This project represents a collaboration between an English teacher, a professor of Teacher Education, six high school musicians, and one fifth grade apprentice.</p>
